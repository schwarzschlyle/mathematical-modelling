This is the template for articles submitted to the Samahang Pisika ng Pilipinas Physics Congress. Using the included BibTeX template one can cite articles \cite{articlekey}, arXiv preprints \cite{preprintkey}, books \cite{bookkey}, and conference proceedings \cite{proceedingskey,proceedingskey1,proceedingskey2}. It is preferred to insert citations before punctuation \cite{articlekey,preprintkey}. Sections, figures, and tables are referred to by the usual \textbackslash{\ttfamily{ref}}\{...\} command (as seen in Section \ref{sec:intro}).
